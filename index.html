        <p>Below I built my first angular app.  It's stupid simple, but hopefully it makes sense.</p>
        <p>The follow are apps I built starting on 8 September 2015:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Get Weather: accesses weather from an API using Angular services
            </li>
            <li>
                Blog app: displays a blog of entries stored, allows people with email addresses to comment,
                and allows the writer to input a password and have an entry be saved. (To a DB?)
            </li>
            <li>
                Customer store: this is a front-facing "store." IN reality it is a list of purchases made.
                It is not editable by a customer.  I created this with the intent to use it as an interaction
                module for one of my businesses.
            </li>
        </ul>
