    TODO:
        Find weather api to use
        Create ng-view field
        Create routing service that gets infor from the API for up to 14 days
        Create html view to inject into ng-view field
        Create functions to be used by each button
            One day--should display one day's worth of info
                Should this be more in-depth than the other ones?
            Five-day through Fortnight
                use ng-repeat in code to pull up slightly different view from what the one-day is
